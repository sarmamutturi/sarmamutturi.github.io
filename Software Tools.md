## Software Tools

I have developed and deployed the following interactive software tools for the research community.

### LC-MS Formula Prediction Tool

This tool predicts plausible $\text{C}_x\text{H}_y\text{O}_z$ elemental formulas from observed LC-MS m/z values and searches the PubChem database for corresponding compounds (focusing on saccharides).
