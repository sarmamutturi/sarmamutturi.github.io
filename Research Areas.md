# Research Areas

My research interests include:

- **Yeast metabolic engineering:** This area focuses on modifying the metabolism of yeast cells to produce valuable compounds or improve fermentation processes.
  - **Tools involved:** CRISPR-Cas9, Molecular Biology, Computational biology, Microbiology, Analytical (GC, GC-MS, LC, LC-MS), Bioreactor cultivation (5-100 L).
- **Studies on niche food enzymes:** I investigate unique enzymes from various sources and explore their potential applications in the food industry.
  - **Tools involved:** Biochemistry, Genomics, MD simulations, Microbiology, Bioreactor cultivation (5-100 L).
- **AI and ML-based analysis:** I use artificial intelligence and machine learning models to analyze complex biological data and predict outcomes in my research.
  - **Tools involved:** Chemometrics, Random forests, SVM, ANN.
- **Lignin bioconversion strategies:** This area explores methods for converting lignin, a complex polymer, into valuable biochemicals or biofuels.
  - **Tools involved:** Genomics, metabolomics, GC-MS.
